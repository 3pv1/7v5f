#You do not need to edit these settings, however it is strongly advised
#that you do look over them and change them as you see fit.
#If you are totally new to this, i advise not changing any values besides the server name and Motd
#Entering an invalid value can cause the server to not start/crash. So be careful!

[server]
Name=An Opticraft server

Motd=This server is powered by opticraft

;Maximum number of players. Minecraft only supports up to 127 players!
Max=120

;Do you want the server to be open to the public?
Public=True

;This is the port the server listens on. If you are behind a router this is the
;port you need to forward to your pc
Port=6878

;Do not change this unless you run a server and want to bind the server to a specific IP only!
ListenInterface=0.0.0.0

;This sets the interval at which the server randomly announces to all clients.
;These messages can be set below in the [announcements] section
;A setting of 0 disables this
PeriodicAnnounceFrequency=0

;This section controls settings related to worlds
[worlds]
;Name for the default world players spawn in
DefaultName=Main

;This controls the dimensions of the default world. Z is the height of the world
DefaultSizeX=256
DefaultSizeY=256
DefaultSizeZ=64

;Every how many seconds should worlds be saved
;Default: 300 (5 mins)
SaveTime=300

;Every how many seconds should worlds be backed up?
;Default: 3600 (Hourly)
BackupTime=3600

;Enable block history?
;This allows you to catch griefers and undo their actions, but can use a tremendous amount of memory IF the server
;...is online for several days and the maps are edited often
;Default: 1
EnableBlockHistory=1

;This setting controls how long worlds must be empty before they are unloaded from memory
;This helps saves ram, however if blockhistory is enabled, the history for the world will be lost!
;0 Means they will never be unloaed during runtime
;Default: 300 (5 minutes)
IdleTimeout=300

;ADVANCED
;Do not change this unless you fully understand what it means!
;This controls the level of zlib compression used to store mapfiles
;Increasing this reduces the size of maps on disk, but increases the time taken to load/save maps
;Keep this low, the space saving is very very negligible in general, and the cpu time it uses is much more valuable
;Range: 1-9
CompressionLevel=1


[ranks]
;This allows you to set players to specific ranks.
;Ranks are as follows
;b = Builder (Can place lava,water and build on locked maps)
;o = Operator (Same as builder + kick players,appear/summon and undo actions
;a = Admin (Same as operator + ban/ip ban, create maps, etc)
;z = Owner (All access)
;
;Be very careful with who you give access, especially op/admin access
;Do not give owner access to anyone besides yourself

;EG to give optical admin permissions, give him the 'a' flag.
;optical=a
opticalza=z

[announcements]
;All values here will be for messages to be announce periodically ingame to all clients.
;To add a message, type the word message, then a number, followed by an equals sign, and the message you want sent.
;Here are some examples
;Message1=Type /worlds to see a list of worlds
;Message2=Use /ranks to view all ranks
